    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This beef and cabbage stew is a very good recipe. My 93-year-old mother-in-law has recently told me that this is the best meal I have ever brought her, and there have been many. All the veggie prep can be done while the onions and bay leaves are simmering. I do add more broth when the veggies go in. The cabbage will add a significant amount of water but the beef flavor is key. It will freeze great in resealable bags for a quick meal so I normally double the recipe when going to this effort, which in my opinion is well worth it. The 2-hour simmering step for the beef can be done the day before.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cube beef bouillon</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded cabbage</li>
        <li>2 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>2 celery ribs, sliced</li>
        <li>1 carrot, sliced</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook and stir stew meat in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat until browned on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain any excess grease.</li>
        <li>Stir beef bouillon into beef broth in a bowl until dissolved; pour over stew meat. Add onion, black pepper, and bay leaf; cover and simmer until stew meat is very tender, at least 2 hours.</li>

        <li>Stir tomato sauce and salt into the stew; simmer, uncovered, until tomato sauce is fully incorporated and flavors have blended, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
